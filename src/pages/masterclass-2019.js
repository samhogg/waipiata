    <h3>Business Case Development &amp; Presentation for AHPs &amp; NGOs</h3>
    <p>
      Over 1.5 days, our team of experienced Aotearoa New Zealand and United
      Kingdom presenters will provide an interactive, evidence-based learning
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Day One</strong> will be a combination of background theory and
      practical group work: how to analyse and scan the healthcare environment
      of Aotearoa New Zealand to identify where a proposed new service/case for
      change could be successful, how to address equity issues, what elements
      need to be in a proposal (e.g. for an ROI, RFP or stand-alone business
      case response), how to incorporate quality, the use of data/information,
      and how to be successful in pitching your ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Day Two</strong> (half day) starts with marketing and branding,
      then moves to a “Dragon’s Den” style event, where participants will work
      together in small groups to present a proposal to a panel of a mock
      Executive Team. Feedback will be provided to all teams.
