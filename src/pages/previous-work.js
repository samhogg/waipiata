    <h4>Allied Health Service Reviews – Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand</h4>
    <h5>
      Allied Health Service Review – Nelson Marlborough District Health Board

    </h5>

      Network – 2014
    </h5>
    <p>
      Waipiata Consulting (Janice Mueller) and Professor Rosalie Boyce were
      jointly commissioned to review the allied health services for the NSW
      (Australia) Justice Health &amp; Forensic Mental health Network, also
      known as JH&amp;FMHN. JH&amp;FMHN is a specialist network with a distinct
      and unique client population and a state-wide reach. It holds a position
      of prominence for models of care in the justice and forensic mental health
      setting due to its significant number of allied health staff (~ 5% of
      their total workforce). The key messages from this review were:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Strong governance approaches depend on developing a mature allied health
        identity and acknowledging the distinct contribution of the member
        professions;
      </li>
      <li>
        Joined-up leadership of allied health throughout the organisation is
        essential to strengthen clinical and managerial performance; and
      </li>
      <li>
        NSW Justice &amp; the Forensic Mental Health Network have unique and
        complex service settings that impact on possible allied health
        organisational and governance approaches.
